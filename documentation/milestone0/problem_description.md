### Project Description


Problem Definition

Many people struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to poor dietary choices and a lack of physical activity. This leads to a range of health issues, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Individuals often find it difficult to keep track of their nutritional intake and the number of calories burned, which can hinder their efforts toward better health.

Possible Solution

The proposed solution is to develop a health tracker application that allows individuals to monitor their food intake and physical activities effectively. The application will provide features such as:

- Food Tracking: Users can log their nutritional values (calories, protein, fat, carbs) they consume.
- Activity Tracking: Users can record their activities, tracking calories burned.

The application will have a simple interface, making it accessible for users of all tech backgrounds.
