### **Project Description**

Many people struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to poor dietary choices and a lack of physical activity. This leads to various health issues, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. One major challenge is tracking nutritional intake and calories burned, which often hinders progress towards better health.

**Possible Solution**

The solution is to develop a health tracker application that helps individuals monitor their food intake and physical activities. Key features include:

- **Food Tracking**: Users can log their nutritional intake (calories, protein, fat, carbs).
- **Activity Tracking**: Users can track their activities and the calories burned.

The application will have a simple, user-friendly interface to ensure accessibility for users of all tech backgrounds.

1. **Environment Setup**
    - Git installation completed.
    - SSH key pair created and uploaded to GitHub for secure communication.
    - User information (name and email) configured in Git.
    - Two-Factor Authentication enabled for account security.

2. **Repository Creation**
    - A new repository, `CC-24-25_NutriNube`, was created on GitHub and initialized with a README file.

3. **README.md**
    - The [README file](/README.md) includes the problem description and key documentation links.

4. **License Selection**
    - The [GNU General Public License](/LICENSE) was selected to ensure the software can be used, modified, and distributed freely.

5. **.gitignore**
    - A Python-template [.gitignore file](/.gitignore) was created to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

6. **Documentation Progress**
    - Ongoing project documentation can be found [here for Milestone 1](/documentation/milestones/milestone0/milestone1.md). Future milestones will be documented similarly.

7. **Issues and Milestones**
    - Tasks were organized into GitHub issues, with a milestone created for project submission.
