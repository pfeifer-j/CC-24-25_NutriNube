### Project Description

Many people struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to poor dietary choices and a lack of physical activity. This leads to a range of health issues, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Individuals often find it difficult to keep track of their nutritional intake and the number of calories burned, which can hinder their efforts toward better health.

Possible Solution

The proposed solution is to develop a health tracker application that allows individuals to monitor their food intake and physical activities effectively. The application will provide features such as:

- Food Tracking: Users can log their nutritional values (calories, protein, fat, carbs) they consume.
- Activity Tracking: Users can record their activities, tracking calories burned.

The application will have a simple interface, making it accessible for users of all tech backgrounds.


### Project Environment

1. Environment Setup
- Git Installation: Git was downloaded and installed.
- SSH Key Pair Creation: An SSH key pair was generated, and the public key was uploaded to GitHub for secure communication.
- User Information Configuration: User name and email were configured in Git.
- Two-Factor Authentication: Enabled to enhance account security.

2. Repository Creation
- New Repository: A new repository CC-24-25_NutriNube was created on GitHub and initialized with a README file.
  
3. README.md
- Problem Description: The README includes a description of the problem being solved in the project.
- Documentation Links: Links to additional documentation for future reference were added.

4. License Selection
- License Documented: An appropriate [license](/LICENSE), the GNU General Public License, was selected for the project to ensure freedom for users to use, modify, and distribute the software while promoting collaboration and community contributions.

5. .gitignore
- The manditory [.gitignore file](/.gitignore) was created and configured with the Python-template to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

6. Documentation Progress
- Project Progress: Ongoing progress of the project has been documented [here for Milestone 1](docs/milestones/milestone0/milestone1.md), with additional links to key documentation sections. Future milestones will be documented in the same fashion.

7. Issues and Milestones
- Task Management: Tasks were defined and organized into issues within GitHub, with a milestone created for the project submission.


### Simple Architecture Prototype
